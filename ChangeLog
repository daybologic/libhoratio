1.1.6-pre2
----------
DDRP - Rename source files to prevent conflicts with C runtime lib
DDRP - Borland makefile cleans up Borland's TDS files
DDRP - Delete out of date dpcrtlmm.mak (Microsoft)

1.1.6-pre1
-----
DDRP - Changed a call of a user function in TrapUnFreedArrays(), which led to a biglock locking after the biglock was uninitialised.
DDRP - Created much needed dpcrtlmm_IsStarted()
DDRP - Added DPCRTLMM_PRIVATE and DPCRTLMM_SPECIAL to version information and autoconfiguration.
DDRP - Added mnemonics for version flags.
DDRP - Safer handling of string buffers in log.c
DDRP - Added line/file info to log files, removed some verbose messages.

1.1.5
-----
DDRP - Problem with make all in Makefile.bor, fixed.
DDRP - Fixed bug with SafetyList_CountFree()
DDRP - Removed implict int usage in two public functions which deal with the debug hook matrix (implicit ints are illegal under C99)
DDRP - Created a big lock to make the library thread safe through mutual exclusion
DDRP - Possible minor bug in shutdown(), moved a call to MESSAGE.
DDRP - Removed an inclusion of signal.h, I cannot figure out why I was using it.
DDRP - Changed example1 & 2 slightly to avoid warnings on Borland C++
DDRP - Trap enablement functions have been made thread safe, the extern dpcrtlmm__EnableTraps is now considered obsolete.

1.1.4
-----
DDRP - Finally started keeping a ChangeLog
DDRP - Added source file and line number storage, AllocEx, CallocEx used, old functions are now macros but only work in C not C++.
DDRP - Added patch number to version function
DDRP - Added block information dumper dpcrtlmm_Dump()
DDRP - #define USING_DPCRTLMM added to make macros malloc(),realloc(),calloc() and free() use DPCRTLMM
DDRP - example3 rewritten
DDRP - Added C based autoconfigurator, build.h only adds more information to the config options now, users have no need to edit it
DDRP - Made stderr usage optional, defaults to stdout
DDRP - Bug fix: Disabling the NULL array from the configurator caused code to try to access the default array even so, used ifdefs around such code.
NOTICE! Changes to user source might be needed, include stdio.h!

Note: I used to keep changes in docs/help.html before 1.1.4
