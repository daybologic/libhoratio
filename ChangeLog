1.1.4
-----
overlord - Finally started keeping a ChangeLog
overlord - Added source file and line number storage, AllocEx, CallocEx used, old functions are now macros but only work in C not C++.
overlord - Added patch number to version function
overlord - Added block information dumper dpcrtlmm_Dump()
overlord - #define USING_DPCRTLMM added to make macros malloc(),realloc(),calloc() and free() use DPCRTLMM
overlord - example3 rewritten
overlord - Added C based autoconfigurator, build.h only adds more information to the config options now, users have no need to edit it
overlord - Made stderr usage optional, defaults to stdout
overlord - Bug fix: Disabling the NULL array from the configurator caused code to try to access the default array even so, used ifdefs around such code.
NOTICE! Changes to user source might be needed, include stdio.h!

1.1.5
-----
overlord - Problem with make all in Makefile.bor, fixed.
overlord - Fixed bug with SafetyList_CountFree()
overlord - Removed implict int usage in two public functions which deal with the debug hook matrix (implicit ints are illegal under C99)
overlord - Created a big lock to make the library thread safe through mutual exclusion
overlord - Possible minor bug in shutdown(), moved a call to MESSAGE.
overlord - Removed an inclusion of signal.h, I cannot figure out why I was using it.
overlord - Changed example1 & 2 slightly to avoid warnings on Borland C++
overlord - Trap enablement functions have been made thread safe, the extern dpcrtlmm__EnableTraps is now considered obsolete.
