2.0.0
-----
  * DPCRTLMM has re-branded to libhoratio!
  * The new libdpcrtlmm wrapper is not a full library, it is a legacy
    wrapper, which passes calls on to libhoratio, and you will need to link
    with both.
  * All legacy calls will emit a warning for one major revision, and
    the legacy symbols and defs will be stripped at revision 3.x.x

1.3.1
-----
  * Fix bugs in implementation of strdup(),
    first introduced in dpcrtlmm 1.3.0

1.3.0
-----
  * 31c91ca539eb: Support strdup().

2006-02-23
----------
  * General tidy up for new configure system

2006-02-21
----------
  * License change

1.2.0 - 2006-02-22
------------------
  * Add GNU autoconf support, remove old configurator.
  * Rename _Trap to Trap internally
  * Change license to a BSD-style license for all code.
  * Examples no longer cause leaks on purpose because automated
    calls to make check might be taking place by something bigger than us.

2005-04-14
----------
  * Fix %p printing warning, some re-formatting.

2002-09-16
----------
  * Fix infinite loop in dpcrtlmm_Dump() and add array pointer to dump.

1.1.6
-----
  * Add support to 'make install' on UNIX-like systems
  * Elimination of new spurious warnings from GCC 3.3 about %p printing
  * Some code re-formatting to my newer style
  * One newline added to an error message
  * __INC_DPCRTLMM_H changed to INC_DPCRTLMM_H in dpcrtlmm.h
  * Removed use of chown during installation, if installing as
    root, this shouldn't matter and group ownership of root's files
    differs on the BSDs.  Let me know how this goes.
  * Elimination of new spurious warnings from GCC 4.0 about %u printing
  * Remove superfluous semi-colon from dpccap.h end of namespace
  * Dependent on supplementary scripts package for OC libtool 0.9

1.1.6-pre3
----------
  * Display array pointer in dpcrtlmm_Dump()
  * Fix infinite loop in dpcrtlmm_Dump()

1.1.6-pre2
----------
  * Rename source files to prevent conflicts with C runtime lib
  * Borland makefile cleans up Borland's TDS files
  * Delete out of date dpcrtlmm.mak (Microsoft)

1.1.6-pre1
-----
  * Changed a call of a user function in TrapUnFreedArrays(), which led
    to a biglock locking after the biglock was uninitialised.
  * Created much needed dpcrtlmm_IsStarted()
  * Added DPCRTLMM_PRIVATE and DPCRTLMM_SPECIAL to version information
    and autoconfiguration.
  * Added mnemonics for version flags.
  * Safer handling of string buffers in log.c
  * Added line/file info to log files, removed some verbose messages.

1.1.5
-----
  * Problem with make all in Makefile.bor, fixed.
  * Fixed bug with SafetyList_CountFree()
  * Removed implict int usage in two public functions which deal with the
    debug hook matrix (implicit ints are illegal under C99)
  * Created a big lock to make the library thread safe through mutual exclusion
  * Possible minor bug in shutdown(), moved a call to MESSAGE.
  * Removed an inclusion of signal.h, I cannot figure out why I was using it.
  * Changed example1 & 2 slightly to avoid warnings on Borland C++

1.1.5b - 2001-08-01
-------------------
  * Release DPCRTLMM 1.1.5b  as source.
  * Trap enablement functions have been made thread safe, the extern
    dpcrtlmm__EnableTraps is now considered obsolete.

1.1.4
-----
  * Finally started keeping a ChangeLog
  * Added source file and line number storage, AllocEx, CallocEx used,
    old functions are now macros but only work in C not C++.
  * Added patch number to version function
  * Added block information dumper dpcrtlmm_Dump()
  * #define USING_DPCRTLMM added to make macros malloc(),realloc(),
    calloc() and free() use DPCRTLMM
  * example3 rewritten
  * Added C based autoconfigurator, build.h only adds more information
    to the config options now, users have no need to edit it
  * Made stderr usage optional, defaults to stdout
  * Bug fix: Disabling the NULL array from the configurator caused code
    to try to access the default array even so, used ifdefs around such code.
    NOTICE! Changes to user source might be needed, include stdio.h!

2001-07-31
----------
  * Added support for big lock (thread safety).

2001-06-07
----------
  * From now on read the ChangeLog, which will list all patches since the
    last release.  Important postings (like the above but only if they are
    of consequence) now go to the mailing list instead.

2001-05-24
----------
  * Added dump and supported functions.

2000-12-12
----------
  * Fixed yesterdays bug with the C++ example not running the trap handler
    after it had installed it when a trap was fired from the library.
    Turned out that the library was started after the trap handler was
    installed.
  * Seems not even the GNU C compiler's -ansi -pedantic -Wall mode spots
    all warnings, on Micro$oft Visual C++ it spotted the missing const in
    parameter 1 of the trap handler.  This only affected the examples not
    the library.  Be clear about my meaning of resetting the library in a
    session by starting it up and shutting it down.  I'm not sure
    everything would be cleared, indeed at the moment it probally wouldn't
    be and I will fix this later.  Also I wouldn't advocate such a thing.

2000-12-11
----------
  * Fixed a bug which I saw by reading the source, statistics for block
    flags were not being returned to the caller from the function
    dpcrtlmm_GetStats( ).  Also got rid of an unneccersary structure.  Is
    was this, forgetting to copy from the structure back to the stats
    structure which was the bug.
  * Fixed bug in C++ example (example2.cpp), it an instance of
    Overlord::TDPCRTLMM_MemManager, which is illegal and probally a mistake
    many users will make.  The real version is global and called
    MemManager, storage reference dpccap.cpp.
  * Another bug found:  Installed trap handler (which displays the stats
    again as a test) in example2.cpp, does not work in example1.c.  It's
    unclear as to what differs at the moment.
  * Managed to get rid of two unneccersary integers in dpcrtlmm.c.
    Functions can use _libStarted (an internal variable).  This would mean
    the library could be restarted from the same session and save a little
    memory.
  * Removed the structure that communicated between both functions to carry
    counts of flags.  Bug fix, the swappable and locked block counts in the
    statistics didn't make it back to the caller's structure.


2000-12-01
----------
  * To fix a possible porting problem I no longer assume
    that realloc() will allocate when called with NULL, newSize

2000-11
-------
  * strtstop.c was renamed husk.c but then removed all together and put
    the startup and shutdown functions from husk.c into dpcrtlmm.c.
  * dpcrtlmm.c contained a #pragma use which caused a warning, I got rid
    of that and got rid of all copyright notices from
    dpcrtlmm.c which would end up in the library.
  * Changed all files to GPL license.
  * Virtually rewrote dpccap.cpp, it's now completely ANSI/ISO
    C++.  I'm not so sure of my '\' line continutation problems in
    September, whatever now, it works.
  * realloc() issues resolved!  I found out recently that
    realloc(NULL, 1024); for example won't neccersarily allocate memory
    so I've added a run-time warning printed to stderr if somebody tries
    this with DPCRTLMM.  Also if somebody tried to use realloc() as a free-er.

2000-09-05
----------
  * I had two different versions of the isbad.c functions, in the C file
    they were constant and in dpcrtlmm.h they were not, caused me two
    warnings on Visual C++ so I corrected the copy on dpcrtlmm.h, so the
    formal version is constant, people.

2000-08-29
----------
  * The GNU C compiler does not support line continuation characters ('\'),
    I believed my source was all ANSI C because I use the -A switch on the
    Borland compiler.  To get rid of line continuations I made changes to
    dpcrtlmm.h and safelist.h.  Of course this does not affect the use of
    the library and it certainly is not worth releasing a new version for.
  * Other porting issues still exist in dpccap.cpp (my C++ encapsulation
    layer), it seems that GNU are right up to date with ANSI/ISO C++ and
    have removed except.h, the new version is simply called except, I have
    not changed these yet as xalloc is still used in this module, it works
    with warnings on Borland C++.  Today I added a clean section to the
    makefile.
  * Attention programmers! There was a typo
    'dpcinstalltrapcallback' in the lazy lazy section of dpcrtlmm.h was
    actually typed 'dpcinstallrrapcallback', sorry about that!

2000-08-24
----------
  * Created a Makefile for Borland C++

1.1.0 - 2000-08-03
------------------
  * Changes between 1.0 and 1.1 are reasonably simple and will only affect
    people who have used the hooking system properly, I had discovered that
    Misc0 and Misc1 are unsigned int and are used as pointers sometimes,
    this works ok in flat model but when segmented the segment is lost, so
    now they are unsigned longs, the trap DPCRTLMM_HOOK_TRAPENABLEMENT was
    removed because it never worked, this is because the variable in
    question is externed so I can't monitor it.  I could not support
    DPCRRLMM_HOOK_INSTHOOK and REMHOOK either, inst hook was too mashed, it
    even calls itself so hooking would be made very difficult indeed.

1.0.0 - 2000-08-01
------------------
  * Altered the way the version number is reported, it now puts data into a
    small structure, S_DPCRTLMM_VERSION, removed the define from build.h
    and made the structure in dpcrtlmm.h
  * I don't think the debug hooks are properly set up I noticed
    dpcrtlmm_CreateBlockArray( ) at no time lead to the hook chain being
    processed.  Must fix this in all functions I suspect.
  * Added dpcrtlmm_IsDefaultBlockArray( )
  * Whoops saw dpcrtlmm_Realloc( ) forgot to resolve NULL arrays, fixed.
  * Invalid page faults were being caused at the end, changed
    raise(SIGABRT) to abort( ), then found this wasn't the real cause, the
    real cause was the library was designed for the static run time library
    and then example was built for the DLL version.  I'll leave that as
    abort( ) anyway.

2000-07-31
----------
  * Hmm, this morning the program no longer halts, if anybody out there
    decides to read this revision history I'd really like to know what was
    going on!  Not a lot of programming done today, too hot.  Only 7 hours
    until it's midnight in the USA so I should have the demos built by
    then.

2000-07-30
----------
  * The change to the loop has (or perhaps not but I suspect it's this) has
    caused the machine to halt running as a 16-bit program under DOS.  I
    have been trying to debug it all day but it's very hard to see what
    goes wrong, might have to re-write this loop in the next release, it's
    too close to release day now, I'll have to say that the library is
    currently limited to flat builds ie. 32-bit.
  * Wrote dpcrtlmm_Ver( ), which uses DPCRTLMM_VER as in build.h


2000-07-29
----------
  * The trap unfreed arrays routine was always seeing one less block then
    it should, traced the problem down to a loop which looked at
    PArr->Count but that count was being changed by dpcrtlmm_Free( ) which
    the routine was calling as automatic garbage collection on every
    unreleased block it found.  I changed it to while ( PArr->Count ) and
    took off element 0

2000-07-28
----------
  * Renamed getstats.c stats.c
  * added support for the default array into
CountFlagsInUse( ).  It seems Alloc( ) is correctly allocating blocks
in the default array because of the NULL array resolver macro, must be
Free( ) that is not so aware.  I have noticed that GrowBlockArray( ) is
relying on the run-time library realloc( ) to accept NULL and pass it
on to alloc( ), I'm not sure that this is always supported, I may have
to change it.  Had to make some changes to isbad.c both IsBad...( )
calls did not resolve array pointers and [32]dpclrtmm_IsBadArrayPtr( )
was so somple it was just asking the safety list.  Some functions may
try dereferencing NULL pointers without resolving them first so I'll
have to find all this instances of this behaviour, all functions which
are exposed in the library so the user can call them will probally be
affected.
    Whoops!  vptrap.c is a bit odd, looking for bad blocks is simple,
it called IsBadBlockPtr( ), seems logical, and yet the trap on a bad
array pointer (the trap above) decides to call the safety list itself,
hmm, it might be more advisable to call IsBadArrayPtr( ) of course,
changing code again....

2000-07-27
----------
  * Fixed a link problem and Mike agreed to test the library.
  * Got Alloc()/Free() to update statistics
  * Got code to work to nag user and terminate the program if more than
    DPCRTLMM_STDBLOCKLIMIT blocks are used in the program, oh and no worries
    it doesn't nag registered users.
  * int_data.c: Added dpcrtlmm_int__blockCount, it's used instead of a time consuming
    loop through all blockarrays, for the call dpcrtlmm_GetBlockCount()
  * Added dpcrtlmm_int__blockCountPeak
  * Added dpcrtlmm_int__allocCharge & dpcrtlmm_int__allocPeak


2000-07-26
----------
  * Added a new module getstats.c, countains these functions:
    dpcrtlmm_GetBlockCount( ) & dpcrtlmm_GetStats( ), GetStats( )
    is very simple and it uses _blockCount which I added to intdata.c.
    Alloc()/Free() don't update the counter yet
  * Limited library to 50 blocks for standard builds, first set up a define
    in build.h so I could modify it easily and then put all the statistics
    (except flag counting) into internal vars (intdata.c).  Flag counting
    is done by an internal routine called CountFlagsInUse( ), I put that in
    getstats.c
  * Added dpcrtlmm_AreTrapsEnabled( )
  * There is now an extern in town called dpcrtlmm__EnableTraps, it used to
    be an internal variable called dpcrtlmm_int__enableTraps, now
    the modifiers dpcrtlmm_EnableTraps( ), dpcrtlmm_DisableTraps( ) &
    dpcrtlmm_AreTrapsEnabled( ) are just macros to use it.
  * The simple module enbltrap.c was redundant, deleted it.

2000-07-24
----------
  * Limited block descriptor arrays to 64 entries in standard builds

2000-07-21
----------
  * Corrected an assertion failure due to the new NULL block array.
  * In the betas, when DPCRTLMM_LOG was not defined the messages were not output
    to a log file but the messages were still taking space in the resulting
    program, got rid of most of them, some are used as traps too so I
    couldn't get rid of them.
  * To try to stop users making the mistake of including build.h in their own
    programs I made build.h look for a macro I define in my source only.
  * Loads of warnings about variables that were never used when I tried to
    define DPCRTLMM_LOG for an experiment, filtered them all out, all
    the #ifdef DPCRTLMM_LOG #endif /*DPCRTLMM_LOG*/ stuff everywhere looks
    a mess though.
  * Added DPCRTLMM_SOURCE at the top of int_data.c

2000-07-20
----------
  * In adding the support for default block arrays I had to split up the
    trap routine called TrapUnFreedArrays() in strtstop.c into a new
    routine also TrapUnFreedBlocks().
  * I realized that not all data which is unfreed (garbage) is just arrays
    now due to the default array which is never destroyed but can contain blocks.
  * I renamed the define DPCRTLMM_TRAP_UNFREED_ARRAYS to DPCRTLMM_TRAP_UNFREED_DATA.
    If you used this (which I doubt) at this stage just rename the macro in your
    code.

2000-07-19
----------
  * Coverted all the filenames to lower case and all the #includes to lower
    case for compatibility with UNIX systems.
  * Tried and failed miserably to create a working makefile and the Borland
    C++ IDE auto-generated one came up with warnings about some of my
    symbols not being in the library, works ok from the IDE and I don't
    ever get warnings for it so I gave up on this for now.  The library is
    saimple enough to build I feel.
  * Merged BBATRAP and BBPTRAP, well, put them in the same module with
    another function call _VerifyPtrs() which calls both, this stops having
    to do both calls in some functions which looks untidy.  Both functions
    were always called at once anyway, the new module is called vptrap.c
  * In realloc.c the string "Realloc()" was used twice, optimized out
    second instance.
  * Noticed quite a few modules called the old BBA trap and did not
    have a pointer to verify also, so I changed _VerifyPtrs() slightly so
    argument three could be NULL and the second trap call would be
    skipped.  Well mustn't grumble, it still feels cleaner this way and I
    got rid of a whole module in effect!
  * Free() used the string "Free()" twice, made it share a variable, only
    has an effect on non-optimizing compilers which don't support duplicate
    strings merged.
  * Removed all #pragma hdrstop PCH support unless DPCRTLMM_HDRSTOP is
    defined, to save annoying warnings to people who's compiler does not
    understand the pragma
  * Added support for NULL as the default built-in block array, define
    DPCRTLMM_NONULL_BLOCKDESCARRAY in build.h to restore old behaviour, old
    behaviour was to say that NULL was not a valid block desc array and
    crash the program.
  * Added a hack table for shorter function names, this was suggested
    by Jeremy and will also shorten the structure names.  Developers
    already using the library can totally ignore this.
  * Added dpcrtlmm_int__defaultArray (the NULL array) to int_data.c

2000-06-14
----------
  * In 16-bit memory models on x86 processors, if the data segment is near
    the pointers do not mean anything to the hosting program when given to
    it, the near pointers are for us with DPCRTLMM's own assumed data
    segment, therefore explicit far data is needed, added a macro to
    build.h for doing so and severely modified the documentation.

2000-05-10
----------
  * There was a bug in the new safety list which stopped the whole library
    working, a single missing '!' (logical not).  Republishing the library.

2000-05-05
----------
  * Wrote documentation for library and released it on the Daybo Logic web
    site http://www.daybologic.co.uk
  * Disabled defintion of hook traps while they are turned off in standard builds

2000-05-04
----------
  * Compiled in the new SAFELIST.C and tried to build the library muliple times
    until all references to other Daybo Logic stuff were stripped out.
  * BOOL had to change to unsigned int, however the user of the library may still
    treat these values as BOOL/TRUE/FALSE even though they are used as unsigned
    ints inside the library.  The user can only do this if they have their own
    compatible versions of BOOL/TRUE/FALSE which most developers have by now, or
    can easily make them if they do now have them.
  * Changed defintion of _safeList and all people who used it had to be altered
    to be aware of the new definition.
  * Wrote a new page on the web site offering it for sale.
  * Changed definition of _safetyList from S_GENLIST _safetyList

2000-05-03
----------
  * Totally got rid of SAFELIST.C/.H and decided to start again.  The
    declaration of the safety list object is in INTDATA.C and the size is
    determined in the configuration file BUILD.H
  * The new SAFELIST.C will contain simple functions to save having to
    write the list processing several times, code to count the number of items,
    code to add a new one at the first blank entry and remove items.
    There is no need for a linked list or shift up code because it's a fixed
    size determined at compile time therefore anything which is not a valid
    entry will just be NULL.

2000-05-02
----------
  * Removed dependencies that made this library rely on other Daybo Logic
    libraries, this will mean the library can be used by Colelus without
    disrupting the portability of the Colelus source tree.  This step
    involves stripping out all references to STDS\DLSTRLIB.H a very
    annoying thing to do because all code which is Daybo Logic shared code
    (and therefore not part of Colelus) should include this header.
    However if this library source is to be made available to the public too,
    this dependancy must go.
  * The other dependency which follows in a similar fasion is the use of the
    generic list object as the list of block arrays, the so-called safety
    list. To avoid this I will design a safety list object type which is only
    used by us and indeed only makes sense to us!
    This new object definition is in SAFELIST.H and the code to run is SAFELIST.C
