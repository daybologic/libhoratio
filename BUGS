This file is not a history of bugs but a list line by line of known
issues in this release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #1: File/line reports in C++ report owner as dpccap.cpp not the true owner.

Issue #2: Truely portable --maxport --enable-threads mutlithreaded builds on UNIX allow callbacks to deadlock
the thread.  I am seeing this as just an unfortunate thing we have to accept and use the NP POSIX extensions
for recursive mutexes if possible.  Unless you have a better idea?

Issue #3: Library can lock the big lock after it is destroyed it during shutdown.
