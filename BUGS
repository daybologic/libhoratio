This file is not a history of bugs but a list line by line of known
issues in this release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue #1: File/line reports in C++ report owner as dpccap.cpp not the true owner.

Issue #2: Truely portable --maxport --enable-threads mutlithreaded builds on UNIX allow callbacks to deadlock
the thread.  I am seeing this as just an unfortunate thing we have to accept and use the NP POSIX extensions
for recursive mutexes if possible.  Unless you have a better idea?

Issue #3: Library can lock the big lock after it is destroyed it during shutdown.

Issue #4: It is not possible to find out which block array we were talking about from a debug report.
Despite the following message being printed to stderr;
DPCRTLMM: "FATAL ERROR! dpc_trap.c, L111: Alloc(): The array base ptr 0x0x2aead87ebe98 was not found in the internal safety list: 11E17E0"
The following message appears in DPCRTLMM.LOG:
DPCRTLMM: "FATAL ERROR! dpc_trap.c, L111: Alloc(): The array base ptr 0x%p was not found in the internal safety list: 11E17E0"
Which means it is not possible to find out what block array we were talking about from a debug report.
Additionally, the 0x is duplicated, although that is library dependent.
